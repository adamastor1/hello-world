Hi there, my name is Adam and I am new to GitHub and programming in general. I'm driven towards maching learning and curious as to how I can help the world through learning and creating things in this format. I'm learning Python to accomlish this, but am always open to seeing what others are doing in other languages. Thanks for reading, cheers!
